How to use Random Generator.py:

To begin using the random generator, first you must adapt a couple things to your computer.
The first thing to do is understand that this program uses text files in order to send and 
receive data. There are 2 text files needed, 1 that contains the number of dice and the
number of sides desired. 

The first text file should have the following contents in the following
format: "(number of dice) (number of sides)" for example: "3 5". This example would generate 
3 random number all within the range of 1 to 5. 

The next text file needed will be the output of the generator. This should just be a blank 
text file. This will be where the output of the generator goes. The output will be in the
following format: "@(number) (number) (number)" for example: "@5 6 3 4". The number of 
integers in the output will vary depending on the input of the first text file.

Both of these files paths will need to be edited within the program to fit the users computer.
There are comments in the code on where these edits should occur.
